# Publish Your First Video

With Vidinfra, you can go from raw video to global streaming in minutes — no infrastructure or video expertise required.

This guide walks you through publishing your first video using either the **Vidinfra Dashboard** or the **Vidinfra API**.

## 🚀 Step 1: Upload Your Video

### Option 1 — Upload via Dashboard

1. Go to the **Vidinfra Console** → **Assets** → **Upload Video**
2. Drag and drop your video file, or click to browse
3. Vidinfra begins processing the file immediately — transcoding it into multiple renditions and adaptive formats (HLS + DASH)

> ✅ Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.avi`, `.flv`

### Option 2 — Upload via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vidinfra.io/v1/assets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIDINFRA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "https://example.com/videos/product-demo.mp4",
    "playbackPolicy": "public"
  }'
