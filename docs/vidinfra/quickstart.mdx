# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you upload, process, and play your first video with **Vidinfra** — a fully managed cloud video infrastructure for ingest, transcoding, and delivery.

In just a few steps, you’ll go from a raw video file to a globally delivered, adaptive streaming playback URL.
