# What is Vidinfra?

Publishing a video online on your own — without using platforms like YouTube or Vimeo — is hard. It involves transcoding your original video into multiple resolutions, figuring out correct bitrates and formats, managing storage, setting up delivery networks, and ensuring playback across devices.

Not to mention the computing cost, engineering effort, and maintenance time needed to build such a pipeline from scratch.

To eliminate all that complexity, **Vidinfra** provides a **complete, programmable video infrastructure platform** built for developers and media teams.
