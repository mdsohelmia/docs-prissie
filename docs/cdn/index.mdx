## ⚙️ Core Concepts

### Distribution
A **Distribution** is a CDN endpoint that caches and serves your content from Tenbyte’s global edge network.

Each distribution has:
- **Origin:** Your source server or storage
- **Domain:** The unique `*.tenbytecdn.com` hostname (or your custom CNAME)
- **Configuration:** Cache rules, headers, and access control policies

Example:
```text
Distribution Domain: d6q8h86gig.tenbytecdn.com
Status: Active
Origin: origin.yourdomain.com
